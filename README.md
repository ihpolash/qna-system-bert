# PDF Question Answering System

## Introduction
The PDF Question Answering System is a powerful application that allows users to extract answers to their questions from PDF documents. By leveraging advanced natural language processing techniques and deep learning models, the system can accurately retrieve relevant information from the PDF content and provide concise answers to user queries.

## System Architecture
The PDF Question Answering System consists of the following key components:

1. **PDF Reader**: The system utilizes the PyPDF2 library to read and extract text content from PDF documents.

2. **Text Preprocessing**: The extracted text undergoes preprocessing steps such as removing special characters, lowercasing, and tokenization to prepare it for further analysis.

3. **Text Chunking**: The preprocessed text is split into smaller chunks to facilitate efficient indexing and retrieval.

4. **Vector Representation**: The text chunks are converted into dense vector representations using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. These vector representations capture the semantic meaning of the text.

5. **Similarity Search**: The Annoy (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah) library is employed to build an index of the vector representations and perform efficient similarity search. This allows the system to quickly retrieve the most relevant text chunks based on the user's question.

6. **Question Answering**: The system utilizes a pre-trained BERT-based question-answering model to extract the precise answer from the retrieved text chunks. The model identifies the start and end positions of the answer within the relevant text.

7. **User Interface**: The system provides a user-friendly interface built with the Streamlit framework. Users can upload PDF documents, enter their questions, and receive the corresponding answers in real-time.

## Installation and Setup
To set up the PDF Question Answering System locally, follow these steps:
